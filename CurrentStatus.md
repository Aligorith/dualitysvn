# Introduction #

This page aims to clearly communicate to all interested parties the current state of development. Hopefully this will help stave off any confusion over the state of the latest version available, etc.


# Status Log #

## 2011 Feb 20 ##

The first official release, given the unassuming version number of "0.1" has now been officially released.

## 2010 Dec 08 ##

After over a week of heavy development, this project has finally reached an important milestone: "self-hosting". In the context of this tool, this means that it is now possible to carry out the most basic of development tasks, although support for some tools is still lacking.

However, this is still not recommended for general public usage yet. Adventurous testers are of course welcome, though support requests will most likely be ignored at this stage.

## 2010 Nov 30 ##

Development of this project has now been moved online.

However, this is still heavily in development, and is not intended for public use yet (if at all possible).
